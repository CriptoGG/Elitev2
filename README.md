# Sci-Fi City Builder (Elite 1984 Style)

A city building game inspired by the aesthetics and some of the open-ended feeling of the classic game Elite (1984).

## Project Goal

To create a functional city builder with resource management, construction, and economic elements, all presented with a minimalist, wireframe graphical style reminiscent of early 80s computer games.

## Current Status

Core gameplay mechanics implemented. The game is playable with basic resource management, building placement, power simulation, population growth, a save/load system, and sound effects. Progression through city ranks by increasing city value is in place, unlocking new buildings.

## Features Implemented

*   **Core Gameplay:**
    *   **Building Placement:** Place various buildings (Command Center, Hab-Domes, Solar Arrays, Ore Extractors, Power Conduits) on a grid. More buildings like Factories and Life Support Nexus are defined with unlock conditions.
    *   **Resource Management:** Manage Credits, Power (generation and consumption), Population (grows with Hab Domes, has capacity), and Raw Ore (generated by Extractors).
    *   **Wireframe Graphics & UI:** Minimalist wireframe style for buildings. UI panels display game status (resources, power, rank, time, FPS) and allow building selection.
    *   **Progression:** Advance through City Ranks based on total city value (cost of buildings). Unlocking new buildings is tied to population, city rank, or (placeholder) technologies.
    *   **Save/Load System:** Save current game progress to `savegame.json` and load it back.
    *   **Sound Effects:** Basic sound effects for UI interactions, building placement, and alerts. (Requires user to add sound files).
*   **Technical:**
    *   Written in Python 3 using Pygame.
    *   Modular design: `main.py`, `game_state.py`, `buildings.py`, `rendering.py`, `ui.py`, `config.py`, `sound_manager.py`.
    *   Unit tests for `game_state` and `buildings` modules.
    *   Basic camera controls (arrow keys or WASD) for map navigation.

## How to Run

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_directory>
    ```
2.  **Set up a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Ensure you have a font:**
    *   Download a retro vector-style TrueType Font (TTF).
    *   Place it in the `assets/fonts/` directory.
    *   Update `src/config.py` and change the `FONT_FILE` variable to point to your font file (e.g., `FONT_FILE = ASSETS_DIR + "fonts/YourVectorFont.ttf"`).
    *   A placeholder `.gitkeep` file is in `assets/fonts/`.
5.  **Run the game:**
    ```bash
    python src/main.py
    ```

## Gameplay Controls

*   **Mouse Left Click:**
    *   Select building from Build Menu.
    *   Place selected building on the grid.
    *   Select an existing building on the grid.
    *   Click UI buttons (Save, Load, Build Menu items).
*   **Arrow Keys / WASD Keys:** Pan the camera view across the city map.
*   **ESCAPE Key:** Deselect the currently chosen building for placement.

## Development Notes

*   The visual style aims for simplicity and clarity, using wireframes or simple filled polygons.
*   Gameplay will focus on strategic decisions regarding resource allocation, city expansion, and economic management.
*   Sound design will also be minimalist, using simple synth sounds.

## Future Ideas

*   More complex economic simulation (supply/demand affecting prices more dynamically).
*   Narrative elements or scenarios.
*   More diverse building types and production chains.
*   More sophisticated AI for events (e.g., smarter pirates).
*   Procedurally generated map features.

## Contributing

This is currently a solo project, but contributions or suggestions might be considered in the future.
